# Sherlock-and-Cost

we have given an array B and must determine an array A and we need to select a series of A[i] given B[i] such that the sum of the absolute difference of consecutive pairs of A is maximized. this will be the array's cost and will be represented by the summation of i=2 to N by A[i] - A[i - 1].
